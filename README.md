# SwaggerGen
Local set up of API2Swagger API. Node.js module. You need a Node Js platform to run the API.


## Web Version
Refer https://krishapispace-live.apigee.io/index for the web version of the APIs.

## Usage
Web version requires you API to be available in internet. That may not be possible for most of enterprise. If every developer of your orginization has local node js set up then it is better idea to install the nps module https://github.com/anil614sagar/api2swagger.
This project is created to expose the API2Swagger as API so that it doesn't need nps set up on each API developer's system. An enetrprise can expose this as API for their internal developers.


## Installtion
For now there is nps installtion available. Download the project and install in node.js environment.

## API Specification
For API specification refer the swagger document in here. https://github.com/KrishanuMaity76/API2Swagger-API-Swagger



### Tools
